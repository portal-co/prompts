Edge cases and TODO tagging
- Always mark ambiguous or training-derived results as TODO:VERIFY with a one-line rationale (e.g., "TODO:VERIFY — inferred from OCR on AGCIS page X or from training model; no explicit PDF citation found"). Keep these entries concise and searchable.
- If a behavior is unknown (e.g., hardware race or missing memo), mark the result as UNKNOWN and add a short note which sources were checked.
- Add any new authoritative citations to the instruction file (PDF path + page numbers) when resolving TODOs.
