Commit and workflow rules (for the Copilot agent)
- Commit messages for automated/AI edits MUST start with "[AI]" followed by a concise description and an ISO timestamp (e.g., "[AI] Expand AD_K pseudocode — 2025-12-07T09:00:00Z").
- Do not modify git config (author/committer). Use git mv for any file moves so Git history is preserved.
- Keep ref/TEMP_INSTR_CHANGES.md entries until a human reviewer removes them; do not delete pending entries automatically.
