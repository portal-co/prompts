# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions: Responsible AI and Attribution Policy

## Purpose
This repository uses GitHub Copilot to assist with code generation. To ensure responsible, transparent, and safe use of AI, Copilot must adhere to the following policy:

---

### 1. **Attribution and Disclaimers**
- **Mandatory Disclaimer:**  
  Any code suggestion or completion produced by Copilot **must** include a clear disclaimer within comments accompanying the code (unless otherwise instructed by a human maintainer).  
  Example:  
  ```python
  # This code was suggested by GitHub Copilot AI. Review carefully; AI-generated code may contain errors.
  ```
- **Minimum Requirement:**  
  If a full disclaimer is not feasible, Copilot must at least add a short comment stating that the code may contain mistakes due to AI generation.

---

### 2. **Respect for Annotated Code**
- **Do Not Alter:**  
  Copilot **must not** edit, overwrite, or reformat code blocks that contain human-written explanatory comments, docstrings, or explicit annotations (e.g., `# DO NOT EDIT`, `# HAND WRITTEN`, doc comments, or similar markers).

---

### 3. **Type Safety and Human Oversight**
- **Non-Type-Safe Languages:**  
  For code written in, or that generates code for, non-type-safe languages (such as JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Bash, etc.), Copilot may **suggest code** but a human must review and approve all such code.  
  - Copilot should add a comment such as:  
    ```js
    // Human review required: AI-generated code in a non-type-safe language.
    ```
- **Type-Safe Languages:**  
  Copilot can generate suggestions for type-safe languages (e.g., TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, C#, etc.) but must still include an attribution disclaimer.

---


### 4. **General Guidance**
- All code generated by Copilot must be clearly distinguishable from human-authored code by its comments.
- Copilot should always prioritize transparency and safety, erring on the side of including disclaimers and requiring human input where appropriate.
