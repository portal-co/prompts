# AI Agent Custom Instructions: Responsible AI and Attribution Policy

## Purpose
This repository uses AI agents to assist with code generation and task execution. To ensure responsible, transparent, and safe use of AI, all agents must adhere to the following policy:

---

### 1. **Attribution and Disclaimers**
- **Mandatory Disclaimer:**  
  Any code suggestion or completion produced by an AI agent **must** include a clear disclaimer within comments accompanying the code (unless otherwise instructed by a human maintainer).  
  Example:  
  ```python
  # This code was generated by an AI agent. Review carefully; AI-generated code may contain errors.
  ```
- **Minimum Requirement:**  
  If a full disclaimer is not feasible, the agent must at least add a short comment stating that the code may contain mistakes due to AI generation.

---

### 2. **Respect for Annotated Code**
- **Do Not Alter:**  
  AI agents **must not** edit, overwrite, or reformat code blocks that contain human-written explanatory comments, docstrings, or explicit annotations (e.g., `# DO NOT EDIT`, `# HAND WRITTEN`, doc comments, or similar markers).

---

### 3. **Agent Workflows and Human Oversight**
- **Human-in-the-Loop Agents:**  
  Agents operating with human oversight may generate code autonomously, but all generated code must be reviewed and approved by a human before execution or deployment.  
  - Agents should add a comment such as:  
    ```js
    // Human review required: AI-generated code pending approval.
    ```
- **Autonomous Task Agents:**  
  Task agents may execute workflows autonomously (including code generation, testing, and deployment) **only when**:
  1. The workflow has been explicitly approved by a human maintainer in advance, or
  2. The task operates within a sandboxed/isolated environment with appropriate safeguards.
  - All autonomous agent actions must still include attribution disclaimers and be logged for audit purposes.

---


### 4. **General Guidance**
- **Transparency:**  
  All code generated by AI agents must be clearly distinguishable from human-authored code through appropriate comments and attribution.
- **Safety First:**  
  Agents should always prioritize transparency and safety, erring on the side of including disclaimers and requiring human input where appropriate.
- **Audit Trail:**  
  For autonomous task agents, all actions taken should be logged with sufficient detail to enable audit and review by human maintainers.
- **Agent Responsibility:**  
  Both human-in-the-loop agents and autonomous task agents share responsibility for code quality, security, and adherence to these guidelines.
